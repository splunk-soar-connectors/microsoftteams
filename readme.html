</ul>
<h2>Authentication</h2>
This app requires creating an app in the Azure Active Directory.

<h2>Configure the Microsoft Teams Phantom app asset</h2>
When creating an asset for the <b>Microsoft Teams</b> app, place the <b>Application Id</b> of the app in the <b>Client ID</b> field and place the password generated during the app creation process in the <b>Client Secret</b> field. Then, after filling out the <b>Tenant ID</b> field, click <b>SAVE</b>. Both the Application/Client ID and the Tenant ID can be found in the <b>Overview</b> tab on your app's Azure page.
<br><br>
After saving, a new field will appear in the <b>Asset Settings</b> tab. Take the URL found in the <b>POST incoming for Microsoft Teams to this location</b> field and place it in the <b>Redirect URLs</b> field mentioned in a previous step. To this URL, add <b>/result</b>. After doing so the URL should look something like:
<br><br>
<p>
https://&lt;phantom_host&gt;/rest/handler/microsoftteams_6ba1906f-5899-44df-bb65-1bee4df8ca3c/&lt;asset_name&gt;/result
</p>
<br>
Once again, click Save at the bottom of the screen.
<br><br>
Additionally, updating the Base URL in the Phantom Company Settings is also required. Navigate to <b>Administration > Company Settings > Info</b> to configure the Base URL For Phantom Appliance. Then, select <b>Save Changes.</b>
<br>
<h2>Method to run get admin consent</h2>

Action should show a success message.
<p>
    <b>Note:</b> If the URL is not displayed while running the <b>get_admin_consent</b> action, the user can get the URL from the following ways:
    <ul>
        <li>User can find the URL in 'spawn.log' file.</li>
        <li>User needs to manually navigate to the URL in a separate browser tab. The URL format is:
        <b>https://&lt;phantom_host&gt;/rest/handler/microsoftteams_6ba1906f-5899-44df-bb65-1bee4df8ca3c/&lt;asset_name&gt;/admin_consent?asset_id=&lt;asset_id&gt;</b></li>
        <p><b>Steps to fetch asset id</b></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Open the asset on which the action is executed.</li>
            <li>URL for the asset will be in the following format:</li>
                <p><b>https//&lt;phantom_host&gt;/apps/&lt;app_id&gt;/asset/&lt;asset_id&gt;/</b></p>
            <li>Take the asset id from the URL.</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
</p>

<h2>Method to run test connectivity</h2>

  <li>The <b>timezone</b> parameter can be configured using the timezone of the microsoft teams calender. If not provided, by default the <b>UTC</b> timezone will be considered for scheduling the meetings.</li>
  <li>In case of add_calendar_event = true, if the user wants to provide schedule time for the meeting, <b>start_time</b> and <b>end_time</b> both the parameters are required.</li>
</ul>
