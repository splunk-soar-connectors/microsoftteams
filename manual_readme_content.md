## Note

-   For an admin user, you can run the test connectivity directly.
-   For a non-admin user, you need to get the admin consent first. This can be done by running the
    action **get_admin_consent** by an admin user.

## Authentication

This app requires creating an app in the Azure Active Directory.

-   Navigate to the <https://portal.azure.com> in a browser and log in with a Microsoft account

-   Select **Azure Active Directory** from the left side menu

-   From the left panel, select **App Registrations**

-   At the top of the middle section, select **New registration**

-   On the next page, give a name to your application and click **Register**

-   Once the app is created, the below steps needs to be performed on the next page:

    -   Under **Certificates & secrets** , select **New client secret** . Note this key somewhere
        secure, as it cannot be retrieved after closing the window.
    -   Under **Authentication** , select **Add a platform** . In the **Add a platform** window,
        select **Web** . The **Redirect URLs** should be filled right here. We will get **Redirect
        
        URLs** from the Splunk SOAR asset that we will create below in the section titled "Configure the
        Microsoft Teams Splunk SOAR app asset".
    -   Under **API Permissions** , the following minimum **Delegated Permissions** from **Microsoft Graph**
        needs to be added:
        -   **OnlineMeetings.ReadWrite** (https://graph.microsoft.com/OnlineMeetings.ReadWrite): Allows an app to create, read online meetings on behalf of the signed-in user. Required to run the **create meeting** action.
        -   **Calendars.ReadWrite** (https://graph.microsoft.com/Calendars.ReadWrite): Allows the app to create, read, update, and delete events in user calendars. Required to run the **create meeting** action with **add_calendar_event** set to true.
        -   **offline_access** (https://graph.microsoft.com/offline_access): Allows the app to read and update user data, even when they are not currently using the app. This permission is required for all actions.
        -   **Channel.ReadBasic.All** (https://graph.microsoft.com/Channel.ReadBasic.All): Read channel names and channel descriptions, on behalf of the signed-in user. This permission is required for 'list channels' action. Required to run the **list channels** action.
        -   **User.ReadBasic.All** (https://graph.microsoft.com/User.ReadBasic.All): Allows the app to read a basic set of profile properties of other users in your organization on behalf of the signed-in user. This includes display name, first and last name, email address, open extensions and photo. Also allows the app to read the full profile of the signed-in user. Required to run the **list users, get admin consent and test connectivity action** action. To run the test connectivity and get admin consent action, User.read scope is sufficient
        -  **ChannelMessage.Send** (https://graph.microsoft.com/ChannelMessage.Send): Allows an app to send channel messages in Microsoft Teams, on behalf of the signed-in user. Required to run the **send message** action
        - **GroupMember.Read.All** (https://graph.microsoft.com/GroupMember.Read.All): Allows the app to list groups, read basic group properties and read membership of all groups the signed-in user has access to. Required to run the **list groups** and **list teams** action

        After making these changes, click **Add permissions** at the bottom of the screen, then
        click **Grant admin consent for <tenant_name>** .

        For revoking the permissions, please refer [this](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/manage-application-permissions?pivots=ms-graph) documentation.

        After removing the permissions from the Azure app, it might still be visible in the state file as those permissions arenâ€™t fully revoked.

        To verify the permissions are revoked or not, follow the below steps:
        - Navigate to the https://portal.azure.com in a browser and log in with a Microsoft account
        - Select **Azure Active Directory** from the left side menu
        - From the left panel, select **Enterprise applications**
        - Select the application used in the asset
        - From the left hand side select **Permissions**
        - In the **Permissions** page go to **user consent**

        If any extra permissions are present in the user consent, then it should be removed.\
        To remove the permissions visible in the **user consent** please refer [this](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/manage-application-permissions?pivots=ms-graph) documentation.

        Note: Following the given steps will remove consent for all the permissions


## State file permissions

Please check the permissions for the state file as mentioned below.

#### State file path


-   For unprivileged instance:
    /\<PHANTOM_HOME_DIRECTORY>/local_data/app_states/\<appid>/\<asset_id>\_state.json

#### State file permissions

-   File rights: rw-rw-r-- (664) (The phantom user should have read and write access for the state
    file)
-   File owner: Appropriate phantom user


## Configure the Microsoft Teams Splunk SOAR app asset


When creating an asset for the **Microsoft Teams** app, place the **Application Id** of the app in
the **Client ID** field and place the password generated during the app creation process in the
**Client Secret** field. Then, after filling out the **Tenant ID** field, click **SAVE** . Both the
Application/Client ID and the Tenant ID can be found in the **Overview** tab on your app's Azure
page.  


The **Scope** configuration parameter's default value is the minimum required scopes. You can add/delete scopes as needed. The scopes added in this parameter should be consistent with those used to create the application on the Azure portal

  
After saving, a new field will appear in the **Asset Settings** tab. Take the URL found in the
**POST incoming for Microsoft Teams to this location** field and place it in the **Redirect URLs**
field mentioned in a previous step. To this URL, add **/result** . After doing so the URL should
look something like:  
  


https://\<splunk_soar_host>/rest/handler/microsoftteams_6ba1906f-5899-44df-bb65-1bee4df8ca3c/\<asset_name>/result

  
Once again, click Save at the bottom of the screen.  
  

Additionally, updating the Base URL in the Company Settings is also required. Navigate to
**Administration \> Company Settings \> Info** to configure the Base URL For Splunk SOAR Appliance.
Then, select **Save Changes.**  

## Method to run get admin consent

Run **get_admin_consent** action. It will display an URL. Navigate to this URL in a separate browser
tab. This new tab will redirect to a Microsoft login page. Log in to a Microsoft account with
administrator privileges. After logging in, review the requested permissions listed, then click
**Accept** . Finally, close that tab. Action should show a success message.

**Note:** If the URL is not displayed while running the **get_admin_consent** action, the user can
get the URL from the following ways:

-   User can find the URL in 'spawn.log' file.

-   User needs to manually navigate to the URL in a separate browser tab. The URL format is:
    **https://\<splunk_soar_host>/rest/handler/microsoftteams_6ba1906f-5899-44df-bb65-1bee4df8ca3c/\<asset_name>/admin_consent?asset_id=\<asset_id>**

      

    **Steps to fetch asset id**

    -   Open the asset on which the action is executed.

    -   URL for the asset will be in the following format:

          


        **https//\<splunk_soar_host>/apps/\<app_id>/asset/\<asset_id>/**

    -   Take the asset id from the URL.

## Method to run test connectivity

After setting up the asset and user, click the **TEST CONNECTIVITY** button. A window should pop up
and display a URL. Navigate to this URL in a separate browser tab. This new tab will redirect to a
Microsoft login page. Log in to a Microsoft account. After logging in, review the requested
permissions listed, then click **Accept** . Finally, close that tab. The test connectivity window
should show a success message.  
  
The app should now be ready to be used.

## Important points to be considered for 'Create Meeting' action

-   The **timezone** configuration parameter will only be used for **Create Meeting** action, when
    the user wants to provide **start_time** and **end_time** of the meeting.
-   The **timezone** parameter can be configured using the timezone of the microsoft teams calender.
    If not provided, by default the **UTC** timezone will be considered for scheduling the meetings.
-   In case of add_calendar_event = true, if the user wants to provide schedule time for the
    meeting, **start_time** and **end_time** both the parameters are required.

default ports used by Splunk SOAR.
